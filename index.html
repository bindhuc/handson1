<h1>Nodejs</h1>
<p>Node js is a combined server for both javascript and database
    where code is execcuted outsibe the web browseer </p>
    <p>
        Any javascript application can be run only on browser, because to execute
         JS code we need JS engine that is present only in browsers like Chrome has V8, Explorer has Chakra.
    </p>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment 
        built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser
    </p>
